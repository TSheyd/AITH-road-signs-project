## Dataset

## Model Architecture
For model, YOLOv8 was used.

## MVP
Although the app is supposed to run on mobile, within this course we do a simpler approach with a demo web app. There you can upload a video, get it processed and see the results. 
The web app provides the processed video, as well as the list of detected items

### Deployment
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed. We used 3.11.
2. Install required packages with `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Run Streamlit app: `streamlit run path_to_project\AITH-road-signs-project\streamlit_app.py`
4. If browser window did not open automatically, go to `http://localhost:8501/`
